--------------- TAXMYPHAGE RESULTS ---------------

Query sequence can be classified within a current genus and species, it is in:

Class: Caudoviricetes
Family: Crevaviridae
Subfamily: Coarsevirinae
Genus: Junduvirus
Species: Junduvirus communis

-------------- INFORMATION MESSAGES --------------

INFO: Current ICTV taxonomy and VIRIDIC-algorithm output appear to be consistent at the genus level

The data from the initial mash searching is below as tsv format

/!\ Remember taxmyPHAGE compared against viruses classified by the ICTV. Allowing you determine if it represents a new species or genus.
It does not tell you if it is similar to other phages that have yet to be classified.
You can do this by comparison with INPHARED database if you wish https://github.com/RyanCook94/inphared or BLAST etc.
