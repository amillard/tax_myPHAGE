Query sequence header was:KY963369


    Query sequence can be classified within a current genus and represents a new species, it is in:

    Class:Caudoviricetes	Family: Not Defined Yet	Subfamily:Not Defined Yet	Genus:Wbetavirus	Species:name_your_species
    
 
    
    
 The data from the initial mash searching is below as tsv format 

    Remember taxmyPHAGE compared against viruses classified by the ICTV. Allowing you determine if it represents a new 
    species or genus. It does not tell you if it is similar to other phages that have yet to be classified 
    You can do this by comparison with INPHARED database if you wish https://github.com/RyanCook94/inphared or BLAST etc
